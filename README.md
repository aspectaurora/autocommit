Autocommit - like having a butler for your git commits, only less British (c) Marc Fasel

It simplifies the process of committing changes by generating meaningful commit messages based on the staged changes.

## Features

- **Automatic Commit Messages**: Generates commit messages using the sgpt command.
- **Custom Context**: Allows adding a custom context to the commit message, useful for linking commits to issues or tasks.
- **Logging**: Supports logging commit messages to a specified file for record-keeping.
